Policy Research Institute, Dec 2016.
Abstract: https://books.google.com/books?id=dzfdDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s
Would households be able to buy more subsidized grains from a food-based
safety-net program if the difference between prices in the program and in
the open market were to increase? This is an important question for safety-
net programs anywhere in the world, but particularly so for the public
distribution system (PDS) of grains in India—the largest food-based safety-
net program in the world. The standard economic intuition suggests that
price controls distort signals and create incentives for unintended
transactions. Price difference between the PDS and the open market
compromise entitlements and divert grains to open markets—an entitlement-
snatching effect. Drèze and Sen (2013), however, posit the opposite—an
entitlement-fetching effect, where an increase in arbitrage increases the
value of PDS entitlement. This raises the stakes in the PDS for eligible
beneficiaries, resulting in a rise in accountability and ultimately an
increase in household purchases of grains from the PDS. We test these two
competing hypotheses using multiple datasets: consumer expenditure surveys
conducted by the National Sample Survey Organization, and panel datasets
from the India Human Development Survey and the Village Dynamics in South
Asia. Depending on the context, we find both entitlement-snatching and
entitlement-fetching effects. In states where welfare programs are better
governed, the Drèze and Sen (2013) conjecture holds. Conversely, in states
like Bihar and Jharkhand—where welfare programs are poorly run—the opposite
pattern holds; that is, households’ purchase of subsidized grains recedes
with greater arbitrage.

Abstract: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3149366
This paper examines the relationship between maternal employment and infant
health in the context of a large workfare program that explicitly
prioritizes female participation, India’s National Rural Employment
Guarantee Scheme. Using multiple estimation strategies including a triple
difference strategy that exploits a discontinuity in program eligibility at
age 18, we find that the program had negative impacts on newborn infant
survival, increasing newborn mortality among women who were eligible to
participate in the program.

This paper examines the relationship between maternal employment and infant
health in the context of a large workfare program that explicitly
prioritizes female participation, India’s National Rural Employment
Guarantee Scheme. Using multiple estimation strategies including a triple
difference strategy that exploits a discontinuity in program eligibility at
age 18, we find that the program had negative impacts on newborn infant
survival, increasing newborn mortality among women who were eligible to
participate in the program.
